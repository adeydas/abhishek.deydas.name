I have been wanting to rant about the difference in approach to immigration between Canada and the USA for some time now but wasnâ€™t able to zone in on an apt way to do so. Finally, I decided to create sort of a flowchart to visually depict my experience and extrapolated it a tiny bit to show what might have happened if I was able to stay in the US.
